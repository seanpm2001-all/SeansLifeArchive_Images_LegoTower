# Start of script
# Lego Tower is closed source, and I don't know what language it is written in, so I chose a random programming language (BOo) as I couldn't figure out what else to make the official project language. I want this project to have a language assigned to it, so I wrote this file in Boo. It feels like it fits, as the game graphics are creepy and unfitting.
